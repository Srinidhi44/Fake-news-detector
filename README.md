## FAKE NEWS DETECTOR 
This project addresses spread of misinfromation by utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically supervised learning algorithms, to detect fake news articles
## About
The biggest challenge in the digital age is the spread of misinformation to society. This work has discussed the utilization of a strong supervised algorithm for learning machines, that is, Support Vector Machines in the detection of fake news through the utilization of a labeled news articles dataset which has been preprocessed by means of tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF-Vectorized feature representations. Being trained to classify an article's authenticity as genuine or false based on such characteristics, the SVM model boasts an impressive capability in fighting misinformation. Our results have shown that SVM can be a robust tool for fighting the trojan horse of fake news and point machine learning based multimedia similarity assessments as being considered to be used as a means of improving media literacy and information integrity in today's increasingly digital landscape.

## Results and Impact
In this project, we have successfully implemented a Fake News Detection System using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which effectively classifies news articles as either real or fake. Through preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and feature extraction using TF-IDF, the model can process textual data efficiently. The SVM algorithm has shown robust performance in distinguishing fake news from legitimate articles, demonstrating its potential in combating misinformation in the digital age. This project not only showcases the power of machine learning in solving real-world problems but also emphasizes the importance of improving media literacy and information integrity in today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape.
